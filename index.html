                <h3>About Baahubali :- </h3>
                <p class="para">Baahubali created a phenomenon. In the history of 100 years
                     of Indian cinema, there are only a few milestones films like 
                      Sholay and Mayabazar. And Baahubali is one of them. It showed 
                      us that the experience of watching cinema could be so profound. 
                      When such films happen, the markets explode. Baahubali expanded the
                       universe of Indian cinema. I think such a phenomenon is unlikely to 
                       happen in the next few decades. Baahubali did not just make profits for 
                       its producers, but it increased the earning potential of the entire Telugu 
                       film industry. That encouraged producers to invest more in movies.
                    
                       Shivu grows up to be an ambitious and mischievous child, obsessed with the goal of ascending the mountain, curious to explore what is the top. Despite Sanga's continuous pleas, he constantly tries and fails repeatedly, albeit improving at each attempt. At the young age of 25, he is shown to possess superhuman strength when he lifts a Lingam of Shiva and placing it at the foot of the mountain. He later finds a mask that has apparently fallen from the top of the mountain.
